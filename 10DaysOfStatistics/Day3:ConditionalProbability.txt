Possible cases:

	 1st  || 2nd 
     1st BB   || BG
     2nd GB   || GG

Knowing that 1 of them is a boy (B), that leaves us with 3 possible cases: {(B,B), (B,G), (G,B)}
The one we are interested in is (B,B), therefore, P=1/3

OR
Using the conditional probability...

P(BB|B) = P(B|BB)*P(BB)/P(B)

P(B) = P(BB) * P(GB) + P(BG) = 3*(1/4) = 3/4
P(BB) = 1/4
P(B|BB) =1 (duh)

-> P(BB|B)=1*(1/4)/(3/4) = 1/3
