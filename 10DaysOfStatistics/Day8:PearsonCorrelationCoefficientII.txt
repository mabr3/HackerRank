eq 1: y = -3x/4 -2
eq 2: x= -3y/4 -7/4

m1 = -3/4
m2 = -3/4

r correlation coefficient

m1=r(std_y/std_x)
m2=r(std_x/std_y)

multiplying the above:
m1*m2=rÂ²*(std_y/std_y)*(std_x/std_x)
r=sqrt(m1*m2)

r= -3/4 or 3/4

Since both original eqs have a negative m (slope), they are negatively correlated -> answer is -3/4
