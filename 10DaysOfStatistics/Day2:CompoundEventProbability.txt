X:
P(red_X)=4/7
P(black_X)=3/7

Y:
P(red_Y)=5/9
P(black_Y)=4/9

Z:
P(red_Z)=4/8=1/2
P(black_Z)=4/8=1/2

One ball from each urn -> no need to have Probability of taking the ball from X, Y, or Z.

Favorable cases:
X Y Z
R R B -> P(red_X)*P(red_Y)*P(black_Z)
R B R -> P(red_X)*P(black_Y)*P(red_Z)
B R R -> P(black_X)*P(red_Y)*P(red_Z)

P = sum Favorable cases=
  = (4/7)*(5/9)*(1/2) + (4/7)*(4/9)*(1/2) + (3/7)*(5/9)*(1/2)
  = 20/126 + 16/126 + 15/126 =
  = 51/126
  = 17/42
